Overview
---
This repository contains starting files for the Behavioral Cloning Project.

In this project, we use what we've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. We train, validate and test a model using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model outputs a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

A simulator is provided where we can steer a car around a track for data collection using a joystick. We use image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.

The project includes five files: 
* model.py (script used to create and train the model)
* drive.py (script to drive the car)
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
* this README report writeup 
* video.mp4 (a video recording of the vehicle driving autonomously around the track for at least one full lap)


The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report


Setup Requirements
---
The lab enviroment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.
* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)


The following resources can be found in the udacity github repository:
* drive.py
* video.py
* writeup_template.md

The simulator can be downloaded from the Udacity classroom along with some sample data.
